# The Legal Form Vocabulary

The **Legal Form Vocabulary** vocabulary defined in
[RDFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDF_Schema)
allows to describe legal forms under which individuals or organizations
carry on some kind of economic, charitable or in other ways beneficial
activity.
This includes but is not limited to forms of the private law such as the
[European SE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Company_Regulation)
or the
[German GmbH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesellschaft_mit_beschr%C3%A4nkter_Haftung);
But also cooperatives, associations or forms of the public law.
The status of a legal form is usually gained by some formal registration
within a jurisdiction but this is not always the case.

The vocabulary is available in the following serializations:

- [JSON-LD](legal_form_vocab.jsonld) (source)
- [RDF/XM](legal_form_vocab.rdf)
- [Turtle](legal_form_vocab.ttl)
